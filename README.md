fh-rest-service-template
========================


An MBaaS Service that runs _fh-rest-express-router_ to facilitate
synchronisation of records between a Client Application and a datastore exposed
by a RESTful API running on an MBaaS Service.

The datastore used is an in-memory store, _fh-rest-memory-adapter_.

You can run this locally like so if you have node.js and npm installed:

```
cd fh-rest-sync-proxy-template
npm install
npm start
```
